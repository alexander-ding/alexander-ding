### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex

I'm an undergrad studying Computer Science at Brown University who enjoys tackling complex engineering problems and creating accessible tools to empower others. I'm a passionate student developer who interned at Bloomberg this past summer, and I also do research in body-aware generative models through Brown Visual Computing.
