### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex

I'm an undergrad studying Computer Science at Brown University who enjoys tackling complex engineering problems and creating accessible tools to empower others. I interned at Bloomberg this past summer, am the projects director at FullStack@Brown, and do research on body-aware generative models through Brown Visual Computing.
