### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alex

I'm an senior at Brown University pursuing a 4-year concurrent ScB/ScM in Computer Science, and I've previously interned at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/what-we-do/), [Google](https://about.google/), and [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/).

Over the years, I've focused on a range of different things, including full stack development, deep learning research, and, right now, computer systems.
You can find out more about what I've worked on at [my website](https://alexding.me)!
